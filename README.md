The whole project is split into getting extracting the data from a mp4 video and actually predicting boulder grades based on the data.


The ClimbCNN and CNN main are the two files to run it. The Customloss file is not entirely necessary as CrossEntropyLoss also works.


I will update the whole repo over time with new things and ideas. I also changed some things so it might not run out of the box.


To implement: 
              
              Make it userfriendy

              Upload the mp4 for dataextraction via Github LSF (its a 20 minute video)
              
              Save the best models
              


With this I invite all of you to try with me and make this a really good method of predicting Kilterboard grades.
